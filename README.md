# bootstrap

*Automating system configuration using Ansible.*

> Review the contents of the `mystation.yml` file first, and make sure you understand all the steps. Feel free to edit it according to your needs and preferences.

Just run one command to set everything up:

```bash
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/millerjmatos/bootstrap/refs/heads/main/tools.sh | bash
```
